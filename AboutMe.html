      <article>
        <p><strong>I am currently a University of Kentucky student furthering my education in Information Science. I previously went to the University of Kentucky for a Biology degree but quickly realized that field that I wanted to pursue a career in the world of IT. I am an avid gamer that devotes a large majority of my free time outside of studying for certifcations and finishing my degree honing my skills for future tournaments.I play a large genre of games but mostly survival, RPGs, and FPS games as of late but I normally always branch out and go back to old school games. I am currently playing Warcraft 3 the old school real-time strategy game that I normally play once or twice every year inbetween dead transition of content. I am just wanting for the next big game to hook me in so I can start dedicating most of my free times towards, but until then I will stick with the classics. </strong></p>
