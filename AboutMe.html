        <p><strong>I am currently a University of Kentucky student furthering my education in Information Science. I previously went to the University of Kentucky for a Biology degree but quickly realized that field that I wanted to pursue a career in the world of IT. I am an avid gamer that devotes a large majority of my free time outside of studying for certifcations and finishing my degree honing my skills for future tournaments.I play a large genre of games but mostly survival, RPGs, and FPS games as of late but I normally always branch out and go back to old school games. I am currently playing Warcraft 3 the old school real-time strategy game that I normally play once or twice every year inbetween dead transition of content. I am just wanting for the next big game to hook me in so I can start dedicating most of my free times towards, but until then I will stick with the classics. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>I would like to grow this community to bring gamers together to showcase their experiences on each game in order completely inform readers. I really believe that gamers share a strong common interest and with that in mind we will be able to grow this site to what it can be for its intended purpose. Let us inform our readers so they can get the full experience of each game so they can never miss another legendary game!</strong></p>
